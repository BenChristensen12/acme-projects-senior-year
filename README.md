ACME Projects for Senior Year

The purpose of this repository is to showcase the projects I completed during my senior year of the ACME program (acme.byu.edu). 
Some of the projects were completed and run from a script. I converted these to jupyter notebook for easier viewing.
I also created example output for many of the functions in these projects so you can quickly see what the project should do.
But not all of the projects have that output.

Many of the projects were completed in jupyter notebook. These are the easiest to see the output. 
More of the "Modeling with Uncertainty and Data" projects were originally coded in jupyter notebook.

The projects are divided in two folders corresponding to the two ACME classes. 
The first is Modeling with Uncertainty and Data. This contains mathematical and statistical analysis of data from
basic linear regression to bootstrapping and data visualiztion.
The second is Modeling with Dynamics and Control. This contains solutions to models represented by differential equations.
